# Azure Relay Hybrid Connector Add-on for Splunk

This add-on is built using Node.js and has been tested on Ubuntu 14.04, Windows 10 and Mac OS X.

It consumes Metrics, Diagnostic Logs and the Activity Log according to the techniques defined by Azure Monitor, which provides highly granular and real-time monitoring data for Azure resources, and passes those selected by the user's configuration along to Splunk. 

Here are a few resources if you want to learn more about Azure Monitor:<br/>

* [Overview of the Azure Activity Log](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-overview-activity-logs)

# Support

If you have encountered difficulties with the add-on, the first thing to do is ensure that all Python and Nodejs dependencies are installed correctly according to the installation instructions in the wiki.  

If that doesn't help, the next thing to do is switch logging for ExecProcessor to Debug (Settings / Server Settings / Server Logging in Splunk Web) and recycle the add-on (disable/enable). Then search for 'azure_monitor' ERROR and DEBUG messages. There will be a lot of DEBUG messages. If you don't see anything helpful, open an issue in the repo.
